## Artemis Papanikolaou

After 6 years of working in various commercial roles, I am excited to move into web and software development.

My passion for communication over cross-functional and physical/virtual teams, my customer-first thinking and my curiosity to always learn have been fused over the past couple of months with web/software development skills and algorithmic thinking. 

I am currently looking for junior web/software development opportunities to add business value through my unique career path.
