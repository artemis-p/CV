## Artemis Papanikolaou

A Junior Software Developer and recent Maker's Academy graduate, with multiple years of experience in commercial roles.

My passion for communication over cross-functional and physical/virtual teams, my customer-first thinking and my curiosity to always learn have been fused over the past couple of months with software development skills and agile ways of working. 

I am excited about projects that can change people's lives.

## Skills

- __Team player__ -  Being a strong
team player and a people person has always been my greatest trait. My previous experience has helped me
understand the importance and strength of working in teams and communicating efficiently with others.
During my previous employment with Sojern, I introduced weekly catch-ups with team members from the
US, UAE and UK to help organise the communication between my co-workers to enhance our productivity
and knowledge sharing as a team. Moreover, during our final project at Makers, after having a bad 2-day
sprint, and not accomplishing what was expected, everyone was unhappy and discouraged. I decided that we
shouldnâ€™t close our day like this, so I recommended spending half an hour, after our retro, and give some
appreciations to each other. The whole effort brought back laughter, jokes and a general feeling of optimism
in the team, giving us the strength to start afresh and work even harder the next morning. 
- __Training/Mentorship__ - I find training others highly satisfying and beneficial for both parties. Throughout my previous roles, I trained several members of my team, as well as senior members of cross-functional teams. During my last employment, I trained and mentored two new members of my team, so they were up-to-speed within the first two months of their hiring; one of them was located in Dubai, which made things trickier due to different time zones, but we managed to overcome the difficulties and established a great communication and support system.
- __Flexible & Adaptable__ - I embrace change and I adapt very quickly. In many occassions in the past, the work environment and my responsibilities changed, but I always managed to handle successfully the extra workload and tolerate the extra time pressure. 
- __Detail-oriented__ - I excel at noticing things and details that other's usually, don't. This trait has proved invaluable throughout my past work experience, as it allowed for spotting mistakes early on various processes and ultimately prevented costly mistakes. It also, helped me spotting irregularities in my code, while debugging projects at Makers.

## Hobbies
- Crocheting & Knitting: Counting stitches and following patterns keeps me focused on the present moment. Throughout the years I managed to improve my concentration, patience, memory skills and creativity. During my last employment with Sojern, I formed a lunch-and-learn team of colleagues to crochet and discuss on the benefits of practising mindfulness through crocheting on stressful working days.
- Fitness: I am a strong believer that physical activity should be a daily addition to everyone's lives, as it can boost our productivity and good mood in the workplace. My favourite classes are spinning and bodypump.
- Cooking & Baking: This is one of the main reasons I loved coding. Both cooking and coding, require persistence, practise and to be flexible on your approach.
