## Artemis Papanikolaou

A Junior Software Developer and recent Makers Academy graduate. I am passionate about building accessible UIs and love how code that I type can have a real impact on people’s lives.

Before Makers, I spent 8+ years working in Pricing and Operations roles in various industries, which gave me invaluable experience in communicating over cross functional and physical/virtual teams and a customer-first mindset. 

My greatest traits are that I am a people person and bring empathy and inclusivity in every working environment. My goal is to build a career in software development, where I can build exciting things and keep on developing.

## Skills

- __Team player__ -  Being a strong team player and a people person has always been one of my best traits. My previous experience has helped me understand the importance and strength of working in teams and communicating efficiently with others. While working with Sojern, I introduced weekly catch-ups with team members from the US, UAE and UK to help organise the communication between my co-workers to enhance our productivity and knowledge sharing as a team. Moreover, during our final project at Makers, after having an unproductive 2-day sprint, and not reaching the expected result, everyone was unhappy and discouraged. I decided that we shouldn’t close our day like this, so I recommended spending half an hour, after our retro, and give some appreciations to each other. The whole effort brought back laughter, jokes and a general feeling of optimism in the team, giving us the strength to start anew and work even harder the next morning.

- __Training/Mentorship__ - I find training others highly satisfying and beneficial for both parties. Throughout my previous roles, I acted as a mentor to several new members of my team. A recent example was from when I was working with Sojern, where I trained and mentored two new members of my team, so they were up-to-speed within the first two months of their hiring. One of the two members was in Dubai, thus arranging regular meetings and virtual catch-ups was vital, to learn together and get to know one another.

- __Flexible & Adaptable__ - I embrace change, and I adapt very quickly. In many occasions in the past, the work environment and my responsibilities changed, but I always managed to handle the extra workload and tolerate the extra time pressure, successfully. Moving from Greece to the UK was a significant change. Within the first six months, I had already made new friends and was up-to-speed with the tasks in my new job. 

- __Detail-oriented__ -  I excel at noticing things and details that other's usually, don't. This trait has proved invaluable throughout my past work experience, as it allowed for spotting mistakes early on various processes and ultimately prevented costly mistakes. It also, helped me noticing irregularities in my code while debugging projects at Makers.

## Hobbies
- Coding/Learning new skills - I started my coding journey by learning how to write "Hello World" in plain HTML and have not stopped coding and learning new things since then.
- Crocheting & Knitting: Counting stitches and following patterns keeps me focused on the present moment. By practising these knitting and crocheting, I have managed to improve my concentration, patience, memory skills and creativity. During my last employment with Sojern, I formed a lunch-and-learn team of colleagues to discuss - while crocheting - the benefits of practising mindfulness through crocheting on stressful working days.
- Fitness: I am an avid believer that physical activity should be a daily addition to everyone's lives, as it can boost our productivity and good mood in the workplace. My favourite classes are spinning and bodypump.
- Cooking & Baking: This is one of the main reasons I loved coding. Cooking and coding, require persistence, practise and to be flexible on your approach.
