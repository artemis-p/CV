## Artemis Papanikolaou

A Junior Software Developer and recent Maker's Academy graduate, with multiple years of experience in commercial roles.

My passion for communication over cross-functional and physical/virtual teams, my customer-first thinking and my curiosity to always learn have been fused over the past couple of months with software development skills and agile ways of working. 

I am excited about projects that can change people's lives.

## Skills

- __Team player__ - I love working in a team environment and I get along well with people. In my past work experience with Sojern, I introduced weekly catch ups with team members from the US, UAE and UK to help organise the communication between my coworkers to enhance our productivity and knowledge sharing as a team.
- __Training/Mentorship__ - I find training others highly satisfying and beneficial for both parties. Throughout my previous roles, I trained several members of my team, as well as senior members of cross-functional teams. During my last employment, I trained and mentored two new members of my team, so they were up-to-speed within the first two months of their hiring, one of them was located in Dubai.
- __Flexible & Adaptable__ - I embrace change and I adapt very quickly. In many occassions in the past, the work environment and my responsibilities changed, but I always managed to handle successfully the extra workload and tolerate the extra time pressure.
- __Detail-oriented__ - I excel at noticing things and details that other's usually, don't. This trait has proved invaluable throughout my past work experience, as it allowed for spotting mistakes early on various processes and ultimately prevented costly mistakes.

## Hobbies
- Crocheting & Knitting: Counting stitches and following patterns keeps me focused on the present moment. Throughout the years I managed to improve my concentration, patience, memory skills and creativity. During my last employment with Sojern, I formed a lunch-and-learn team of colleagues to crochet and discuss on the benefits of practising mindfulness through crocheting on stressful working days.
- Fitness: I am a strong believer that physical activity should be a daily addition to everyone's lives, as it can boost our productivity and good mood in the workplace. My favourite classes are spinning and bodypump.
- Cooking & Baking: This is one of the main reasons I loved coding. Both cooking and coding, require persistence, practise and to be flexible on your approach.
