## Artemis Papanikolaou

After 6 years of working in various commercial roles, I am excited to move into web and software development.

My passion for communication over cross-functional and physical/virtual teams, my customer-first thinking and my curiosity to always learn have been fused over the past couple of months with web/software development skills and algorithmic thinking. 

I am currently looking for junior web/software development opportunities to add business value through my unique career path.

## Hobbies
- Crocheting & Knitting: Counting stitches and following patterns keeps me focused on the present moment. Throughout the years I managed to improve my concentration, patience, memory skills and creativity. During my last employment with Sojern, I formed a lunch-and-learn team of colleagues to crochet and discuss on the benefits of practising mindfulness through crocheting on stressful working days.
- Fitness: I am a strong believer that physical activity should be a daily addition to everyone's lives, as it can boost our productivity and good mood in the workplace. My favourite classes are spinning and bodypump.
- Cooking & Baking: Following a recipe and keep practising on it, as well making additions once you are comfortable with it, was what made me love programming. You have to have persistence, keep practising and start making additions once your feel more comfortable with it!
